# FCC Front End Libraries Projects: Random Quote Machine

In late-2018 / early-2019 I went through freeCodeCampâ€™s Frontend curriculum while working full-time in a non-programming job. 

This was my take on the Random Quote Machine: https://filipemts.github.io/FCC-Random-Quote-Machine/

Quotes are fetched from Programming Quotes API at https://programming-quotes-api.herokuapp.com
